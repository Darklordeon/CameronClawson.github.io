                    <h3>Annabelle Herringway</h3>
                    <p>One fiesty sailor, thats for sure. With 
                        her cutlass, her handy flintlock pistol, and
                        her ability to set up shorings to block the 
                        way for any enemy trying to get through her 
                        team&rsquo;s defences, she is an asset to 
                        any team.</p>

                    <h3>Justin the Faithful</h3>
                    <p>A priest that took to the Heroing business 
                        when the church he swears to comes upon hard 
                        times. Armed with a mace and the ability to 
                        curse areas to hinder enemies and bless areas 
                        to aid allies; he hopes to stav off the forces 
                        of evil while doing what he can for his church.</p>

                    <h3>Edward Fleshcarver</h3>
                    <p>After the fall of the Kingdom he served for, he 
                        seeks to restore his honor and pride by saving 
                        those he can. With his trusty bow he used as a 
                        ranger and his myriad of traps he can use to 
                        hurt and hinder his enemies, he will do what is 
                        necessary to make it happen.</p>

                    <h3>Ash WordSeer</h3>
                <p>Rather than doing Heroism for glory or for the 
                    greater good, Ash seeks the funds for his Secret
                    Research Project. What is it? Who knows? All we 
                    know is that he is armed with a staff with 
                    magic arching like lightning and the ability to 
                    craft Magical devices that attack foes with 
                    devastating power. He is one to be feared and 
                    respected.</p>
